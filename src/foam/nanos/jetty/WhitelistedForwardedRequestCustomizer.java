/**
 * A whitelist-featured customizer which looks at an HTTP request for headers which indicate it
 * has been forwarded by one or more proxies. Currently, this customizer can only the handle X-Forwarded-For
 *
 * If a whitelist is set up and the X-Forwarded-For header exists:
 *    the customizer will then check most recent IP address of the request against the whitelist and if it does pass,
 *    the remoteAddress of the request will be set to the address in X-Forwarded-For.
 * If a whitelist is not set and the X-Forwarded0For header exists:
 *    the customizer will log the IP address of the request and fail the request
 * If NO whitelist is set up:
 *    then all requests with the X-Forwarded-For header will have their remoteAddress set to the address in X-Forwarded-For
 * Requests WITHOUT the X-Forwarded-For header will be unaffected by this customizer
 *
 * For more info on X-Forwarded-For:

     * If we have an IPv6 address with no square brackets or port

     * 
     * Currently Jetty doesn't consider the case of when they receive an IPv6 address with no square brackets and port
     * This is a problem because AWS injects X-Forwarded-For headers like so: 2001:DB8::21f:5bff:febf:ce22:8a2e
     * 
     * As a cause if we just inject this string as is, the last octet gets truncated because the program thinks its the port
     * the address will end up like so: 2001:DB8::21f:5bff:febf:ce22
     * 
     * For more info on X-Forwarded-Header functionality with AWS Load Balancers:
     * @see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/classic/x-forwarded-headers.html#x-forwarded-for">AWS: X-Forwarded-Headers</a>
     * 
     * Until this is fixed, what we will do instead of creating another class is first detect if these naked ipv6 addresses exist in the header
     * Then we will parse it accordingly into square brackets: [2001:DB8::21f:5bff:febf:ce22:8a2e]
     * We are normalizing the IPv6 address as per rfc2732
     * @see <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2732.txt">Noramalized IPv6</a>
     * 
     * By default the port will be set to 0 for addresses with no ports specified
     * 
     * The address will appear like so [2001:DB8::21f:5bff:febf:ce22:8a2e] with the square brackets attached
     * This is fine according to http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/lrcon/62955/HTML/default/viewer.htm#a003165928.htm
     * As the square brackets are OPTIONAL if you do not specify a port number
     * 
     * Just for reference, a properly structured ipv6 address with ports should look like this: [2001:DB8::21f:5bff:febf:ce22:8a2e]:60
     * If in the future we get X-Forwarded-For headers injected in this style, it should be handled normally by HostPort
