<h2>Setup</h2>
<h3>Development</h3>
For local development add the following entries to /etc/hosts
<ul>
  <li>127.0.0.1  mm1</li>
  <li>127.0.0.1  mm2</li>
  <li>127.0.0.1  mm3</li>
  <li>127.0.0.1  mn1</li>
  <li>127.0.0.1  mn2</li>
  <li>127.0.0.1  mn3</li>
</ul>

<h4>Building and Launching</h4>
Build and deploy in the following order. The first build in each group must be clean -c, so to assemble the correct journals.  Else you may end up with a Node build with Mediator journals.
NOTE: using -j will clear the existing ledger. Use with caution.
<ol>
  <li>./build.sh -uJcluster,cluster_l,mn -Nmn1 -W8100 -c</li>
  <li>./build.sh -uJcluster,cluster_l,mn -Nmn2 -W8110</li>
  <li>./build.sh -uJcluster,cluster_l,mn -Nmn3 -W8120</li>
  <li>./build.sh -uJcluster,cluster_l,mm -Nmm1 -W8080 -c</li>
  <li>./build.sh -uJcluster,cluster_l,mn -Nmm2 -W8085</li>
  <li>./build.sh -uJcluster,cluster_l,mn -Nmm3 -W8090</li>
</ol>

<h2>Topics</h2>
<h3>Replay</h3>
Replay is the act of loading a ledger into memory. From a file based journal into an MDAO.
A Mediator monitors for Nodes on the network and requests Replay when the Node is ONLINE.  The Node initiates Batched sending of it's ledger entries to the Mediator.
Replay is considered completed when a Mediator has reached consensus on all ledger entries from a quorum of Nodes.

<h3>Status: ONLINE | OFFLINE<h3>
A Mediator is ONLINE when Replay is complete and the electorate Primary is IN-SESSION.
A Node is ONLINE when it's internal Replay (from ledger to MDAO) is complete.

<h3>Viewing Data</h3>
Presently both the Nodes and Mediators can be logged into with the admin account.

  <li>Ledger data is visiable from menu <b>Medusa Entry</b></li>
