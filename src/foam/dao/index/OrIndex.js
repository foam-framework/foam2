/**
  In most cases MDAO takes care of splitting up OR predicates for you, and
  you will never need an ORIndex. In the case you call Or.toIndex(), this
  class is necessary to produce a valid index.

  ORIndex runs multiple plans over the clauses of the OR predicate, and
  combines the results. Typically an AltIndex will be used under the ORIndex
  to optimize the various sub-queries the OR executes.
