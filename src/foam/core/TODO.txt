ToDo:
  - refining a Property doesn't update instances
  - model validation
    - abstract methods
    - interfaces
  - more docs
  - Axiom ordering/priority
  - The defineProperty() and setPrivate() pattern is used in several spots, maybe make a helper function

 ???:
  - ? proxy label, plural from Class to Model

 Future:
  - predicate support for getAxioms() methods.
  - cascading object property change events
  - multi-methods?
  - Topic listener relay
  - Should String be the default property type with no way to create an untyped property?
  - Design by Contract
