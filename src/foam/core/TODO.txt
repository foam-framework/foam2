ToDo:
  - refining a Property doesn't update instances
  - model validation
    - abstract methods
    - interfaces
  - more docs
  - Axiom ordering/priority
  - The defineProperty() and setPrivate() pattern is used in several spots, maybe make a helper function

 ???:
  - ? proxy label, plural from Class to Model

 Future:
  - predicate support for getAxioms() methods.
  - cascading object property change events
  - should destroyables be a linked list for fast removal?
    - should onDestroy be merged with listener support?
  - multi-methods?
  - Topic listener relay
  - Should String be the default property type with no way to create an untype property?
  - Design by Contract

An ExpressionSlot's sub() method is overloaded since it is both an FObject and a Slot.
