    Axiom for declaring intent to implement an interface.

    Since interfaces can also have implementations, it
    can also be used to provide mix-ins, which is a safe form of
    multiple-inheritance.
  <pre>
    Ex.
    foam.CLASS({
      name: 'SalaryI',
      properties: [ 'salary' ]
    });

    foam.CLASS({
      name: 'Employee',
      extends: 'Person',
      implements: [ 'SalaryI' ]
    });
  </pre>
  Employee extends Person through regular inheritance, but
  the axioms from SalaryI are also added to the class.
  Any number of mix-ins/interfaces can be specified.
