  documentation: `An agent that is able to authenticate on application's behalf
      for HTTP requests that require authorization. Implementations must do the
      following:

      (0) Export self as "authAgent" (already done in base class);
      (1) Register an auto-authenticating HTTPRequest as 'foam.net.HTTPRequest'
          in agents' sub-contexts;
      (2) Implement getCredential() and refreshCredential().

      Clients instantiating agents must provide a requiresAuthorization(request)
      implementation; this allows authenticating HTTPRequests to determine
      whether or not to authenticate before attempting a request.`,
