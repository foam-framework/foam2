A simple demo for using and consuming the foam.tools.Build tool. To use, start
by running:

  node demos/buildtool/build.js

Then start a simple http server:

  python -m SimpleHTTPServer

And access a detail view of the build model via the following URL:

  http://localhost:8000/demos/buildtool/

NOTE: This is all super experimental and will be changing frequently so if you
depend on any of this behavior, be prepared to get broken as time goes on.
