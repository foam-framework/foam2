FOAM is, fundamentally, about data. It takes the object-oriented view of data: the smallest unit of data is an object, and an object is a collection of properties and methods.

## Defining Data Objects

In Java, you write a class definition using special syntax:

{% highlight java %}
public class MyClass extends BaseClass {
  private int someField;
  public MyClass(someField) {
    this.someField = someField;
  }
  public int getSomeField() {
    return someField;
  }
  public void setSomeField(int sf) {
    someField = sf;
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

This creates a *class*, and you can use `new` to create an *instance* of that
class.

FOAM's approach is similar in principle: you write a definition for the class,
and at runtime that creates a class which your code can instantiate.

FOAM's class definitions take the form of a JSON object passed to the `CLASS()`
global function. The following defines a class similar to the Java one above:

{% highlight js %}
foam.CLASS({
  name: 'MyClass',
  extends: 'BaseClass',
  properties: [
    {
      Class: ‘Int’,
      name: 'someField'
    }
  ]
});
{% endhighlight %}

### Parts of a Class

In both Java and FOAM, a class has a `name`, a parent class
(`extends`) that defaults to a fundamental class (`FObject`), properties
and methods.

The difference is that FOAM's classes are much richer than
their Java counterparts.

FOAM properties are like public member variables, and are accessed in the same
way: `point.x += 10`. But they have many more features: `postSet` functions
to call when the property's value changes, the `view` to use when displaying
this property to the user, `expression` for spreadsheet-style reactive
programming, `value` and [much more]({{ site.baseurl }}/tutorial/phonecat/8-appendix).

FOAM models support `constants`, mixins (known as `traits`), special kinds of
methods (`actions`, `listeners`, and `UI library`) and more.

### A Simple Example

Here's a simple class:

{% highlight js %}
foam.CLASS({
  name: 'Point',
  properties: ['x', 'y'],
  methods: {
    function scale(s) {
      this.x *= s;
      this.y *= s;
    }
  }
});
{% endhighlight %}

and it can be instantiated and used like this:

{% highlight js %}
var p = Point.create({ x: 10, y: 20 });
p.scale(2);
p.x += p.y;
console.log(p.toJSON());
{% endhighlight %}

which will output

{% highlight js %}
{
  "class": "Point",
  "x": 60,
  "y": 40
}
{% endhighlight %}

So you can see that, whatever might be going on under the hood, these objects
can be manipulated very much like plain old Javascript objects: read and write
their properties, call their methods, and so on. The main difference is that new
instances are created with `MyClass.create({...})` rather than `new MyClass(...)`.

### Extending Classes

Classes can extend other classes, which means they will inherit all of the
parent class's properties and methods (and listeners, actions, ...).

{% highlight js %}
CLASS({
  name: 'Point3D',
  extends: 'Point',
  properties: ['z'],
  methods: {
    function scale(s) {
      this.SUPER(s);
      this.z *= s;
    }
  }
});
{% endhighlight %}

This defines a new class `Point3D` that extends `Point`. It inherits all the
properties (`x` and `y`) of `Point`, and adds a new one, `z`. It would inherit
the method `scale` too, but instead overrides it.

This overridden method calls `this.SUPER(s)`, which is similar to calling
`super.scale(s)` in Java.

Because `class` and `super` are reserved (but unused) words in
Javascript, FOAM uses these alternative spellings.

### Properties

In the example above, we created a property with a simple string, `'z'`. This
defines a property with that name on the class. There are *many* more
interesting things to set on a property. These are detailed in the
[appendix]({{ site.baseurl }}/tutorial/phonecat/8-appendix).

### Listeners, Actions and Templates

These are three kinds of special methods on a class. They are called like normal
methods.

Listeners always bind `this` correctly, so they can be conveniently passed as
DOM event handlers. They can also be rate-limited, or delay until the next
animation frame.

Actions are operations the user can perform on an instance of this class,
like `send`ing an email. They can define `isEnabled` and `isAvailable` to
control their state in the UI.

FOAM has a UI library, `U2`, which can be used to generate UI elements of a web page.

`U2` will be discussed in more detail in
[part 4]({{ site.baseurl }}/tutorial/phonecat/4-UI), more information about all
three special kinds of methods is in the
[appendix]({{ site.baseurl }}/tutorial/phonecat/8-appendix).


## MVC

MVC is a classic pattern for breaking up applications into reusable, decoupled components. The conventional definition of MVC is as follows:

- **Model:** Stores and represents your data.
- **View:** Presents this data to the user, for viewing and maybe editing.
- **Controller:** Mediates between the other two.

Many frameworks focus on the model and the view, which are almost by definition
application-specific. Every app needs its own data types, its own forms, and its
own style of presentation. But the definitions of the models and their views can
be pretty lightweight, especially if you're given some extensible, customizable
components for common needs.

FOAM goes a step farther and allows controllers to be generic, so that they can
operate on all kinds of models and views. In many cases, FOAM's default
controllers can be used to build the structure of your application, requiring
you to write code only for application-specific details while the controllers
provide navigation, animations, editing, searching, and more.


### Controllers

We find that most applications fall into one of a few categories. With the right
amount of abstraction on both your data and views, a generic and reusable
controller for each archetype of app can be created.

For example, FOAM has a reusable `ThreePaneController` for the ubiquitous
"list of filters on the left, table of items on upper right, and details of
selected item on bottom right" style of app. (This archetype fits Gmail, Outlook
and iTunes, for example.) Navigation is built into the controller, your app need
only specify the views and provide a DAO.

These reusable controllers are a big part of why FOAM can develop applications
so rapidly. Of course, if none of FOAM's controllers suit your needs, you can
extend one or write your own. FOAM is a library, and it does not limit your
options.


## Reactive Programming

FOAM has excellent support for reactive programming. Reactive programming is a
spreadsheet-like style of computation that abstracts the details of dataflow.
You specify a value in terms of some others, and FOAM hooks up event listeners
for you to make sure the values are in sync. This saves the programmer from the
burdens of writing event handlers, callbacks and manual data binding.

FOAM's reactive programming support is event-driven, and therefore has minimal
overhead. It does not do dirty checking; instead, each update to a value ripples
through the data model, triggering further updates, and so on. No handlers are
run when none of their inputs have changed. This is why FOAM's reactive
programming support scales so well; it's still very fast with thousands of
bindings.

The various ways of hooking up reactive listeners are detailed in the
[appendix]({{site.baseurl}}/tutorial/phonecat/8-appendix).

### Animation

Animations in FOAM are similarly rich; an animation is a reactive program with
time as an input, after all.

FOAM includes a suite of animation functions that make it easy to have
components ease in or out, slide smoothly, bounce, spin, orbit, and more.


## Miscellany

FOAM tries to provide many missing utilities from Javascript and web platform.
It has fast JSON and XML parsers, a parser combinator library, a `SyncManager`
that can sync data for offline use, a powerful asynchronous function library,
unit and regression testing, and more.

## Overhead

FOAM is largely written in itself, which helps keep it compact despite all these
features. Because of this meta-programming nature, FOAM is not very large.

Minified and gzipped, it weighs in at 122 KB as of late November 2014. There is
a great deal in the core codebase currently that should not be there; as FOAM
moves towards a 1.0 release we will cut it into smaller pieces.
