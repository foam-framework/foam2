## **What is FOAM?**

*Fast apps fast.* FOAM (Feature-Oriented Active Modeller) is designed to help developers write apps faster. It is a system for converting abstract models into concrete software implementations. 

The main features of FOAM are: 

- An advanced class system, similar in principle to Java's but much more powerful.
- A Javascript library for abstracting across data sources with helpers for caching, logging, etc.
- A view library for use in building web applications.

For more information about the philosophy of FOAM, select the following link to [About FOAM](https://katemengjunxia.github.io/foam/about/) or follow this tutorial and dive right in.    

## **Audience**

This tutorial is for people who are familiar with Javascript and building web apps but who do not know FOAM's concepts or functions.
